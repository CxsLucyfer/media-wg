### Agenda

This agenda can be viewed and updated on [GitHub](https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/blob/main/meetings/2022-01-11-Media_Working_Group_Teleconference-agenda.md).

Part of this meeting will be a joint meeting with the Second Screen Working Group, which seeks input from experts on Media Capabilities. There are two issues to discuss, related to the [Open Screen Protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/openscreenprotocol/), which supports the [Presentation API](https://www.w3.org/TR/presentation-api/) and [Remote Playback API](https://www.w3.org/TR/remote-playback/).

* [w3c/openscreenprotocol#194 Remote Playback: Capabilities for HDR rendering and display](https://github.com/w3c/openscreenprotocol/issues/194)

* [w3c/openscreenprotocol#233 Use the same codec names as the media APIs](https://github.com/w3c/openscreenprotocol/issues/233)

We should have time to cover other Media Working Group topics. If you would like to add an item to the agenda, please open a pull request against this agenda.
