* [w3c/encrypted-media#451 Add "usable-in-future" to MediaKeyStatus](https://github.com/w3c/encrypted-media/issues/451) - xhwang-chromium
> There are cases where we could have a license containing a key whose start time is in the future, e.g. to support key rotation. In the current spec, there's no corresponding MediaKeyStatus for this case. It's not "usable", so the closest one is "expired", which looks really odd.

* [w3c/encrypted-media#473 Handling hardware context reset](https://github.com/w3c/encrypted-media/issues/473) - xhwang-chromium
> Putting this back in the agenda as it was discussed at the previous call but it wasn't clear if we had a consensus.

* [w3c/media-wg#16 Triage MSE/EME issues](https://github.com/w3c/media-wg/issues/16) - tidoust
> Tag issues as v2 or vNext in order to build a scope for the next iteration.
